== Description ==

This plugin has been designed specifically for <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive" title="Responsive">Responsive</a> but will also work on any theme. Wordpress is working with theme
developers like <a href="http://cyberchimps.com" title="CyberChimps">CyberChimps.com</a> to make sure that the theme's functionality is limited to design,
layout and structure and that anything that falls outside of this is developed as a plugin. Hence the reason why this plugin has been developed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `responsive-add-ons.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why have the Webmaster options moved to a plugin? =

Wordpress is very keen (as we are) to separate functionality from design. Among other things it keeps themes from being bloated, it's cleaner code wise and allows users to choose what features they
 want.

= Will it work for any theme? =

The short answer is yes. The long answer is that whilst we have created this primarily for our <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive" title="Responsive">Responsive</a> theme we decided
that it was important to make it inclusive rather than exclusive.

== Screenshots ==

1. Responsive Add Ons plugin is recommended when you have the <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive" title="Responsive">Responsive Theme</a> installed and active
2. After clicking on the install plugin you are taken to the suggested plugin installer, just click on "Install" below the plugin name
3. The plugin gets downloaded and installed automatically
4. Responsive Add Ons places it's options inside <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive" title="Responsive">Responsive's</a> theme options
5. Even if you don't have the Responsive theme it will still add it's functionality to any other theme. You will be able to find the options in the settings tab
