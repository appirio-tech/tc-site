Control widget areas on a per-page / per-post basis.

== Description ==

Control widget areas on a per-page / per-post basis.

Gives you the ability to show or hide individual widget areas on each page / post as well as completely substituting the widgets shown in a specific widget area on a specific page or post.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip `i123_per_page_widgets.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. The default box added to the edit page for each page or post. By default the setting is "Standard" which means the Per Page Widgets will not affect your current sidebar and widget setup. The plugin also adds a little link to edit widget directly in an overlay.
2. When selecting "Special" from the main dropdown, you are given detailed control of each widget area. You may show, hide or set special widgets for any area defined by your theme.
3. The widget editor shown in an overlay. With this you will edit the custom widgets using the exact same interface that you are used to.
